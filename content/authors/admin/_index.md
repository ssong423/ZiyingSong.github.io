## About Me

Hi! I’m Ziying Song — currently a master’s student in Data Science at Columbia University. I enjoy building things that make data more useful, whether it’s a backend system for a knowledge graph or a full-stack AI tool powered by ChatGPT. My background blends software engineering and machine learning, and I’ve interned at places like Siemens and ByteDance. Outside of work, I’m usually walking around the city, cooking something new, or sketching whatever catches my eye.
