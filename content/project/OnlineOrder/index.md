- Implemented CRUD REST APIs using Spring controllers, with features such as registration, adding to cart, and checkout.  
- Used Spring Data JDBC and repositories to manage user and store data, interfacing with a **PostgreSQL** database on **AWS RDS**.  
- Designed application authentication via **Spring Security**, employing session-based authentication mechanisms.  
- Architected the project with a clear separation of concerns into controller, service, and repository layers, applying **dependency injection** for advanced maintainability.  
- Built the **Front-End** with **ReactJS** and **Ant Design**, allowing users to add items to the cart and place orders seamlessly.  
- Containerized the build with **docker** and deployed it to AWS App Runner with auto-scaling.
