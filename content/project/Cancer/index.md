Built and evaluated classification models to predict breast cancer malignancy based on medical measurements.

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on breast cancer malignancy data, utilizing L1 logistic regression, MDS (optimal with Canberra measure), and PCA. Employed a 3:1 dataset split for cross-validation.
- Implemented classification methods with R, including Logistic Regression, KNN, QDA, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and CNN.
- Evaluated accuracy, AUC, and sensitivity across different EDA datasets. Achieved 99.14% accuracy and 98% sensitivity with KNN, with Area as the most influential predictor.
