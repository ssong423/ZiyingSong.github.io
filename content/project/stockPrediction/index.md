Engineered models to forecast stock price movement using high-frequency market microstructure data.

- Engineered advanced feature sets from market microstructure data, incorporating volume metrics, price spreads, and temporal patterns
to predict stock price movements, optimizing LightGBM to achieve the lowest MAE of 4.9874.  
- Designed and evaluated models (LightGBM, Random Forest, GRU, CNN-LSTM) using out-of-time validation to ensure temporal
consistency, leveraging feature standardization and rolling window calculations to enhance predictive accuracy. 
- Conducted stock-specific analyses across 200 stocks, optimizing trading strategies through model-driven insights.
